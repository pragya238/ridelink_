# 🚗 RideLink — Your Ride, Your Way

> A ride-hailing system built as a System Design & OOP project, demonstrating real-world software architecture principles including Design Patterns, SOLID, and UML-based modeling.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://ridelinksysdes.netlify.app/](https://ridelinksysdes.netlify.app/)

## 📋 Project Overview

RideLink is a full-featured ride-hailing platform simulation that connects Riders with verified Drivers across multiple vehicle categories — Economy, Premium, Bike, and Auto. The project is designed to demonstrate applied knowledge of:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Software Design Patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer, Singleton)
- SOLID design principles
- UML Diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence)
- Scalable system architecture

The system supports real-time ride matching, dynamic pricing strategies, live status tracking via the Observer pattern, and a single centralized RideManager instance to coordinate all active rides.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla) |
| **Hosting** | Netlify (Static Deployment) |
| **Architecture** | OOP + Design Patterns (no backend framework) |
| **Design Patterns** | Factory, Strategy, Observer, Singleton |
| **Modeling** | UML (Class, Use Case, Sequence Diagrams) |
| **Version Control** | Git / GitHub |

> Note: This is a frontend-only simulation project. All logic is implemented in JavaScript following OOP and design pattern principles. No backend server or database is used — the focus is on demonstrating system design concepts in code.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Git (optional, for cloning)
- A code editor like VS Code (optional, for development)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ridelink.git
   cd ridelink
   ```

2. **Open the project**

   Simply open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   open index.html

   # On Windows
   start index.html
   ```

   Or use VS Code's Live Server extension for a better development experience.

3. **No build step required** — this is a pure HTML/CSS/JS project with no dependencies or package managers.

## 🏗️ Architecture Explanation

RideLink's architecture is built around four classic Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns:

### 1. Factory Pattern — Vehicle & Driver Creation
The `VehicleFactory` interface is implemented by `EconomyFactory`, `PremiumFactory`, and `BikeFactory`. Each factory is responsible for creating the correct vehicle-driver pair for a given ride type, decoupling object creation from business logic.

### 2. Strategy Pattern — Dynamic Pricing
The `PricingStrategy` interface is implemented by three concrete strategies:
- `BasePricing` — Standard fixed-rate (1.0× multiplier)
- `SurgePricing` — Peak-hour dynamic pricing (example: 1.8× multiplier)
- `NightPricing` — Late-night enhanced rates (1.3× multiplier)

Strategies are interchangeable at runtime without modifying the core fare calculation logic.

### 3. Observer Pattern — Real-Time Status Updates
The `RideObserver` interface is implemented by `NotificationService` and `AnalyticsService`. Whenever a ride's status changes, all registered observers are notified simultaneously — enabling real-time push notifications and analytics tracking independently.

### 4. Singleton Pattern — Centralized Ride Management
`RideManager` is a Singleton — only one instance exists globally. It maintains the `activeRides` map, preventing race conditions and ensuring consistent state across all ride operations.

### Core Domain Model
- `User` (abstract) → extended by `Rider` and `Driver`
- `Rider` books and cancels rides; `Driver` accepts rides and updates location
- `Ride` links a Rider, Driver, pickup/dropoff locations, status, and fare
- `RideStatus` enum: `REQUESTED → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED`
- `VehicleType` enum: `ECONOMY | PREMIUM | BIKE | AUTO`
